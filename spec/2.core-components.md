# Core Components

Here are the core components of Mantra and how they are organized:

## Client-Side Focus

Mantra gives special attention to the **client side** of your app. Mantra does not mix client and server code together; instead, it recommends code sharing. Here are the reasons why:

* Client side is where you put in a lot of effort. It's the biggest part of your codebase. Server-side codebase is relatively simpler to manage and organize.
* In the future, client-side apps will interact with the server using a schema. Client-side apps will have no idea how the server was implemented.
* Mantra [does not believe in Universal Apps](https://voice.kadira.io/say-no-to-isomorphic-apps-b7b7c419c634#.hogcs5r24). It encourages multiple apps for different platforms with code sharing. Then it's common to have a single server to interact with a few client apps.

Based on the above factors, it's not a good idea to mix client and server code together.

**When we discuss Mantra further in this specification, it will be about the client side of your app.**

However, most of the apps will have server-side components. So, we have a directory layout for the server side as well. For that, refer to [Appendix B](#sec-Appendix-Server-Side-Directory-Layout).

## ES2015 Syntax and ES2015 Modules

We rely on different features of ES2015 and its module system. In order to use Mantra, you need to use [Meteor 1.3](https://forums.meteor.com/t/meteor-1-3-early-beta-now-available/14723), which comes with an implementation of the ES2015 module system.

## React as the UI

We use React as the UI (presentation) layer in Mantra.

When creating UI components you should pass all data and event handlers via props.

Note: You could handle the React state inside a component, but that should not interact with the rest of your app. Therefore, Mantra highly recommends you avoid using states.

When writing your UI components, you can include any other React component. Here are some places you can import React components:

* Other UI components you define in your app.
* UI components from NPM (like material-ui).
* Any Containers in your app (we'll talk about this in a moment).

You can also import any library function and use them in the UI components. You can import them directly from NPM modules, but not from any Meteor packages. These functions should be [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).

Here's a simple UI component:

```html
import React from 'react';

const PostList = ({posts}) => (
  <div className='postlist'>
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post._id}>
          <a href={`/post/${post._id}`}>{post.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>
);

export default PostList;
```

## Actions

Actions are where you write the **business logic** in your app. This includes:

* Validations
* State management
* Interacting with remote data sources

An action is a simple function that accepts the first argument as the whole [Application Context](#sec-Application-Context) in your app. Other arguments usually come when invoking the action.

Note: Inside an action, everything you do should be based on the Application Context and other arguments passed to the action. You should not import any ES2015 module except [libraries](#sec-Libraries). You should also avoid using Global variables inside actions.

Here are some actions:

```js
export default {
  create({Meteor, LocalState, FlowRouter}, title, content) {
    if (!title || !content) {
      return LocalState.set('SAVING_ERROR', 'Title & Content are required!');
    }

    LocalState.set('SAVING_ERROR', null);

    const id = Meteor.uuid();
    // There is a method stub for this in the config/method_stubs
    // That's how we are doing latency compensation
    Meteor.call('posts.create', id, title, content, (err) => {
      if (err) {
        return LocalState.set('SAVING_ERROR', err.message);
      }
    });
    FlowRouter.go(`/post/${id}`);
  },

  clearErrors({LocalState}) {
    return LocalState.set('SAVING_ERROR', null);
  }
};
```

## State Management

In an app, we need to deal with different kinds of states. We can divide them into two different categories:

1. Local State - State in the client-side app that will never be synced with a remote server (errors, validation messages, current page).
2. Remote State - This is the state usually fetched from a remote server and synced with it.

We have different solutions for managing states in our app, including:

* Meteor/MiniMongo (Remote State)
* Tracker/ReactiveDict (Local State)
* FlowRouter (Local State)
* Redux (Local State)
* GraphQL (Remote State)
* Falcor (Remote State)

This is where a lot of innovation is happening in the JavaScript community. So, Mantra is flexible when it comes to state management. You can use anything you want.

For example, you can use the following for your app when starting:

* Meteor/MiniMongo (Remote State)
* Tracker/ReactiveDict (Local State)
* FlowRouter (Local State)

Later on you can move on to different solutions.

Note: However, Mantra enforces a few rules when managing your states.

* Any write operations to states should be done inside an action.
* You can read states in both actions and containers.
* You should not read or write into states directly inside UI components. UI components should know nothing about states in your app.

See the following links for some sample usage of states:

* [Reading from local state - inside a container](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/modules/core/containers/newpost.js#L6)
* [Writing into local state - inside an action](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/modules/core/actions/posts.js#L4)
* [Reading from a remote state - inside a container](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/modules/core/containers/postlist.js#L7)

## Containers

Containers are the integration layer in Mantra. They perform these actions:

* Pass states into UI components.
* Pass actions into UI components.
* Pass items in Application Context into UI components.

A container is a React component.

Containers are composed using [react-komposer](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-komposer). It supports different data sources, including Meteor/Tracker, Promises, Rx.js Observable, and nearly anything else.

Normally, inside a container you need to write the following functions:

* composer functions to get data from state managers.
* mapper function to get data from dependency injection layer.

We have some rules when creating a container:

* There should be only one container inside a single file and the container should be the default export.
* composer functions and the mapper function should be exported from the container module.
* Composer functions should only use variables coming via props.
* The mapper function should be [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).

Note: If you need to pass the Application Context to a component, do it via props using a mapper.

Here's an example container:

```js
import PostList from '../components/postlist.jsx';
import {useDeps, composeWithTracker, composeAll} from 'mantra-core';

export const composer = ({context}, onData) => {
  const {Meteor, Collections} = context();
  if (Meteor.subscribe('posts.list').ready()) {
    const posts = Collections.Posts.find().fetch();
    onData(null, {posts});
  }
};

export default composeAll(
  composeWithTracker(composer),
  useDeps()
)(PostList);
```

## Application Context

Application Context is available to all actions and containers, so this is the place for shared variables in your app. These include:

* Meteor namespace
* Meteor Collections
* LocalState
* FlowRouter
* Any other Meteor package
* Redux Stores
* Rest Clients
* DDP Clients

Here's a simple Application Context:

```js
import * as Collections from '/lib/collections';
import {Meteor} from 'meteor/meteor';
import {FlowRouter} from 'meteor/kadira:flow-router';
import {ReactiveDict} from 'meteor/reactive-dict';
import {Tracker} from 'meteor/tracker';

export default function () {
  return {
    Meteor,
    FlowRouter,
    Collections,
    LocalState: new ReactiveDict(),
    Tracker
  };
}
```

## Dependency Injection

Mantra uses dependency injection to isolate different parts of your app including UI components and actions.

We use a project called [`react-simple-di`](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-simple-di) that uses React Context behind the scenes. It accepts both [Application Context](#sec-Application-Context) and [Actions](#sec-Actions) as dependencies.

Once configured, Application Context will be injected into each action. That's the first argument of an action. So, you don't need to pass the application context manually.

Application Context can be accessed within [Containers](#sec-Containers) as well.

### Configuring Dependency Injections

Dependencies will be injected into the top-level components in your app. Usually, it'll be a Layout Component. You can do the injection inside your routes. See:

```js
import React from 'react';
export default function (injectDeps) {
  // See: Injecting Deps
  const MainLayoutCtx = injectDeps(MainLayout);

  // Routes related code
}
```

## Routing & Component Mounting

Note: When we refer to components, we consider both containers and UI components.

We normally use a Router to mount components to the UI. There could be multiple solutions (for example, [Flow Router](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/) and [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)).

The Router's only functionality in Mantra is to mount components to the UI. It's just a tool.

See how to use FlowRouter as the router:

```js
import React from 'react';
import {FlowRouter} from 'meteor/kadira:flow-router';
import {mount} from 'react-mounter';

import MainLayout from '/client/modules/core/components/layout.main.jsx';
import PostList from '/client/modules/core/containers/postlist';

export default function (injectDeps) {
  const MainLayoutCtx = injectDeps(MainLayout);

  FlowRouter.route('/', {
    name: 'posts.list',
    action() {
      mount(MainLayoutCtx, {
        content: () => (<PostList />)
      });
    }
  });
}
```
Note: If you need to redirect upon some condition (for example user is not authorized) use an action instead of route options like FlowRouter's triggersEnter. Call the action from component or container's composer function.


## Libraries

Every app has some utility functions to do different tasks. You can also get them via NPM. These libraries will export functions. So, you can import them anywhere in your app including inside actions, components, and containers. But they must be [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).

## Testing

Testing is a core part of Mantra. Mantra helps you test every part of your application. Rules we've enforced will help you write those tests. You can use familiar tools such as [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) to perform testing.

With Mantra, you can unit test three core parts in your app. See:

* UI components - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/modules/core/components/tests/post.js)
* Actions - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/modules/core/actions/tests/posts.js)
* Container composers and deps mappers - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/modules/core/containers/tests/post.js)

### UI Testing

For the UI testing we use [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). Click [here](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/modules/core/components/tests/post.js) to see some sample test cases.

## Mantra Modules

Mantra follows a modular architecture. All the components of Mantra except ["Application Context"](#sec-Application-Context) should reside inside a module.

You can create as many as modules you like and communicate between them via imports.

### Application Context & Modules

[Application Context](#sec-Application-Context) is the core of the application. It needs to be defined in a place which does not belong to any module. All the modules can access Application Context as a dependency and modules should not update the Application Context.

### Module Definition

A Mantra module may contain a definition file. It exposes actions, routes, and a function accepting the context. It is the `index.js` file of a module.

A simple module definition looks like this:

```js
export default {
  // optional
  load(context, actions) {
    // do any module initialization
  },
  // optional
  actions: {
    myNamespace: {
      doSomething: (context, arg1) => {}
    }
  },
  // optional
  routes(injectDeps) {
    const InjectedComp = injectDeps(MyComp);
    // load routes and put `InjectedComp` to the screen.
  }
};
```

### Implicit Modules

If the module has no actions or routes, or no need to do any initialization, then it's okay to avoid using a definition file. These implicit modules may contain the following:

* UI components
* Containers
* Libraries

### Module Containers & UI Components

Module containers and UI components should be able to be imported via ES2015 modules.

### Module Actions

A module can expose actions via namespaces. These namespaces are global to the app and the module should take responsibility for making them unique. A module can expose multiple namespaces.

Finally, all these namespaces from each module are merged and can be accessible inside actions and containers.

### Routes

For routing, you can use any routing library. It's okay to have route definitions inside multiple modules if needed.

### Core Module

Mantra is 100% modular and there should be at least one in an app. We call this the core module. It's just a simple module, but you load it before any other module. This module is the best place to put:

* core routes,
* application configurations,
* common libraries,
* common actions

and other application-specific code.

There are multiple ways to organize modules depending on the app. Refer to [Appendix C](#sec-Appendix-Organizing-Modules) for some of those methods.

### Sub Modules

Inside a module, you **cannot** have sub modules. This is a decision made to prevent unnecessary complexity. Otherwise, it's possible to write multiple layers of nested modules, and that's very hard to manage.

## Single Entry Point

With Mantra, we want our app to be predictable. Therefore, there is a single entry point in your app. That's the `client/main.js`.

It'll initialize the Application Context and load all the modules in your app. Here's an example `client/main.js` file:

```js
import {createApp} from 'mantra-core';
import {initContext} from './configs/context';

// modules
import coreModule from './modules/core';
import commentsModule from './modules/comments';

// init context
const context = initContext();

// create app
const app = createApp(context);
app.loadModule(coreModule);
app.loadModule(commentsModule);
app.init();
```
